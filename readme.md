# Sales Prediction Using Python 📊📈

This project demonstrates how **machine learning techniques** can be used to **predict sales** based on historical data. It walks through data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Sales prediction helps businesses plan inventory, marketing strategies, and revenue targets. In this project, we:
- Analyze historical sales data
- Identify key factors influencing sales
- Build a machine learning model to predict future sales
- Evaluate the model using standard regression metrics

The project is implemented as a **Jupyter Notebook** for clarity and step-by-step understanding.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains sales-related information such as:
- Advertising or promotional spend (if applicable)
- Product or region details
- Historical sales values

The data is loaded from a CSV file and processed using **Pandas** for analysis and modeling.

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Import Required Libraries**
2. **Load and Explore the Dataset**
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and scaling
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Trend visualization
5. **Train-Test Split**
6. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression / other regression models
7. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Sales trends over time
- Feature vs Sales relationship plots
- Correlation heatmap
- Actual vs Predicted sales comparison

These visualizations help in understanding sales patterns and model performance.

---

## ✅ Results

- The model predicts sales with **reasonable accuracy**.
- Evaluation metrics indicate good performance on unseen test data.
